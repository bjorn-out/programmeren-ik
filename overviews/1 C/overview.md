# Module 1: C

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!

## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

2. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.


## Academic Honesty

Do keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus) (like plagiarism).


## Grading

Code is not just a means to an end. You'll find that there are infinitely many ways to solve any kind of problem through code, some of which are better, and some are definitely worse. What constitutes good code is open to debate and often subject to the environment and time it is written in and for. Are you collaborating with a couple of classmates, or working with another 1000 engineers on the same project? Do you expect the code to be reused, and maybe extended, or are you just going to use it once?

Throughout this course we ask you to think critically on what constitutes good code, and to use your time here to practice writing code that is not just functional, but amongst other goals, also understandable and usable by your future-self and others. By the end of this course, you have both an informed opinion and are prepared to face the reality that is code written by others, or even more frightening, your past-self.

To help you get there, we will introduce several aspects of code quality each week/module. These will be listed here, in this section. Your submission will be primarily graded on these aspects and all aspects of previous weeks. Do feel encouraged to ask questions, discuss with classmates and reach out to your TA to discuss any of the aspects. You'll find that programming is a world of trade-offs, and therefore a never-ending source of discussion, opinions, and arguments.

This week we focus on:

- [Comments](/quality-aspects/comments)
- [Naming](/quality-aspects/naming)
- [Indenting code](/quality-aspects/indentation)
- [Whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace)

## How to Submit

Instructions for submitting are included in the problem specifications as linked above.


## Grading

Above, the weight of each problem is noted. All programs have to be submitted in full in order to progress to the next module, which will be automatically checked using `check50`. Normally, you can see the results on this website soon after submitting.

Your TA will assess your programs as soon as every student has finished the module.
