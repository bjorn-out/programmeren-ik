# Module 2: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about cryptographic techniques and about strings in C. Strings will prove to be an important part of almost any program, indeed.

## Grading

In this module we'll focus on the following quality aspects:

- [Magic numbers](/quality-aspects/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality-aspects/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality-aspects/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality-aspects/nesting)

In addition to:

- [Comments](/quality-aspects/comments)
- [Naming](/quality-aspects/naming)
- [Indenting code](/quality-aspects/indentation)
- [Whitespace](/quality-aspects/whitespace)

## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Use `help50` (if unsure what an error message means) and `debug50` (if your code is buggy).

2. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.
