# Installing Jupyter Notebooks

Alright, here we go again!

Log into <https://cs50.io/> and execute the below in a terminal window.

    mkdir ~/workspace/module5/
    cd ~/workspace/module5/

In this week's problems, we will be using a system called Jupyter Notebooks. In order to install Jupyter, execute the below in your CS50 IDE's terminal window.

    wget https://progik.mprog.nl/modules/data/install/install_jupyter.sh
    bash install_jupyter.sh
    rm install_jupyter.sh
